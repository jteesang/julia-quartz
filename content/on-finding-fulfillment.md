_Written to ground my intentions as I make career decisions (i.e.- quit my job) that will drastically change my current state of living_

## What Am I Looking For? ##
Despite asking this question after every positive Hinge encounter, I realized that I hadn't asked this question in a while for how I wanted to live my life.

> For the past two years, I had simply accepted the way of living and prioritized [[how to pass time]] versus chasing after what I wanted to do in the first place.

## How did we get here? ##

When I passed the 2 year mark at my current job, I thought to myself _"What's next?"_. I came to the realization that it was a question I hadn't asked myself in several months. 

As with all difficult questions (mainly due to the vast unknown of the "future"), I started by reflecting back on how the past 2 years went.

## How I spent my time in the past two years / 24 months ##
- Started working in **February 2022** (WFH in Texas) [Month: 0]
	- Joined my first team
	- Spent every waking hour and weekend learning how to sew
	- Prepared to move to Northern Virginia and picked up knitting
- Moved in **Sept 2022** (Hybrid in Northern Virginia) [Month: 8]
	- Adjusted to NOVA and made several knitting friends online
	- Worked a lot of late hours (conversely, did not work as much during the day)
- Rotated to a new team in **Feb 2023** [Month: 13]
	- Learned a lot about database migration and API development
	- Started getting attached to work and staying at the office til 8pm
	- Team picks up a new project in May 2023
	- Enjoyed the team dynamic and the manager
- Loaned to another team in **July 2023** [Month: 18]
	- First time I began to feel like I was the only one truly dedicated to working on the team
	- Left behind my half-baked design for a project I was leading
	- Picked up two new projects that I had to lead for the next 3 months on loan
- Moved in **Aug 2023** [Month: 19]
	- Distinctly remember walking in the parking garage from my car and felt a rush of anger into my body, which I played off as *"taking responsibility and ownership"*
- Returned to first team in **October 2023** [Month: 21]
	- Continue to work on the existing project from the first team
	- No real end in sight - lots of drama/politics from leadership
- Reorg in **Jan 2024** [Month: 24]
	- Previous manager leaves the org, morale is low
	- One team member is PIP'd
	- Another team member transfers to a sister team
	- Only two existing team members left

Naturally, all good things come to an end. The second team that I joined provided a team dynamic where every member uplifted each other and the manager supported us dearly despite the unknowns of the project.

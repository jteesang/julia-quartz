*Written as a reminder of how I want to spend the most precious and equal commodity that we are given, time.*


This guide is meant to serve as an outline for your thoughts and should be treated with deep thought and care. Your answers can be different from mine and should be tailored to meet your own needs and fulfillment.

## Ask Yourself: ##

### _1. "What does time mean to me?"_ ###

For me, it is the singular most precious resource in life that I have control over. With this in mind, I must consciously question how I am using it. 
### _2. "How do I currently spend my time?_" ### 
See the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix) to categorize your day-to-day tasks. 

For me, don't pass time just to pass time. Prioritize what you want to do instead of passing time. This ensures that you are using time wisely.

## Notes: ## 

- You don't need to be a productivity guru and min/max your time to no end  - balance spending your time creating / putting things in motion versus enjoying the simpler things in life like the spring breeze.
- Routine is key. Showing up with discipline on most days will outweigh any cracked kid.

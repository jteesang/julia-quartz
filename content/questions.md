## Quick Thoughts ##
- Why are most mainstream songs only 2-3 min long? 
	- Can long-form songs exist to provide longer focused productivity blocks? (Think pomodoro 25min long or classical music with several movements)
	- Similar to DJ sets where the set changes based on the mood/environment
	- Can we create a framework to convert existing songs to this format?
- How does culture directly affect the progression of a society?
	- in japan, nearly all cars in Tokyo are EV and if not, they resort to walking or bicycles
		- all vehicles are the same boxy size - does this physical quality allow for more vehicles to fit in a given traffic lane?
	- in contrast in taiwan, motorcycle/scooters are the household staple and EVs are few and far between
- How does the logistics of transportation of supply differ between large corporations vs. small businesses?

## Reimagining ##
- How can we reimagine baggage claim carousels so that customers have a better UX?
	- RFID baggage tags to get precise location, show it to a customer in their airline app
	- Use a screen display to show the approx time when bags are unloaded from plane -> carousel - provide ETA
	- Retrofit to existing carousels (renovation is expensive and takes a lot of time!)
	- How to deal with lost baggages?
- How can we reimagine clothing displays at the malls?
	- merge marketing + try-on into a screen so that when the customer walks by, they will see themselves in a virtual try-on session
	- reduces cost on mannequins, try-on rooms, time spent on reorganizing tried-on clothes
